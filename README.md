## TRAFFIC RULES VIOLATION CHALLAN GENERATION USING AI
The AI-Powered Automatic Traffic Challan Generation System automates the detection of traffic violations using computer vision and deep learning techniques, enabling real-time monitoring, license plate recognition, and automatic digital challan generation to improve road safety and enforcement efficiency.

## About
AI-Powered Automatic Traffic Challan Generation System is an intelligent traffic enforcement solution that leverages Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision to detect traffic rule violations automatically. Traditional traffic monitoring relies heavily on manual supervision, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in coverage.

This system uses high-resolution surveillance cameras to capture real-time traffic video streams. Advanced deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) are employed to detect violations like red-light jumping, helmet non-compliance, overspeeding, and triple riding. Once a violation is detected, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to extract the vehicle’s license plate number. The extracted data is verified with the RTO database, and a digital challan is generated automatically and sent to the vehicle owner via SMS or email.

## Features
* Real-time traffic violation detection using YOLO
* Automated license plate recognition using OCR
* Automatic digital challan generation
* Integration with RTO database for owner verification
* SMS and email notification system
* Secure storage of violation evidence (images & videos)
* High scalability for smart city deployment
* Reduced human dependency and enforcement bias
* Data-driven traffic analytics and reporting
  
## Requirements
* Operating System: Windows 10 (64-bit) or Ubuntu (64-bit)
* Development Environment: Python 3.7 or later
* Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow (2.x),OpenCV,YOLO (YOLOv3 / YOLOv5),Tesseract OCR,NumPy,scikit-learn
* Tools:VS Code (IDE),Git (Version Control)
* Hardware: High-resolution CCTV / IP Cameras,GPU (recommended for faster training and inference)

## Results and Impact
The AI-Powered Automatic Traffic Challan Generation System significantly improves traffic law enforcement by automating violation detection and penalty issuance. It reduces manual workload, minimizes errors, and ensures fair and transparent enforcement.

The system enhances road safety by discouraging repeated violations through timely notifications. It also provides valuable analytics for authorities to identify accident-prone zones and improve traffic planning. The project demonstrates the effective application of AI and computer vision in smart city infrastructure and intelligent transportation systems.
